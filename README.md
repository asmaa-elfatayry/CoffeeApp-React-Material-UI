# Coffee React App

This project is a simple React application created to learn Material-UI and practice building a project with it. It includes various sections like Home, About, Live Style, Products, Contact, Offers, and a Footer. The project does not use routing or Redux; it is intentionally kept simple to focus on learning Material-UI concepts.
