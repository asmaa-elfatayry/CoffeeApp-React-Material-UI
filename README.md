# Coffee React App

This project is a simple React application created to learn Material-UI and practice building a project with it. It includes various sections like Home, About, Live Style, Products, Contact, Offers, and a Footer. The project does not use routing or Redux; it is intentionally kept simple to focus on learning Material-UI concepts.

## Videos

To demonstrate the responsive nature of the Coffee React App, two videos have been created.

- [Computer Screen Video](./Screens%20Design/desktop.mp4)
- [Mobile Screen Video](./Screens%20Design/mobile%20preview.mp4)

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the Coffee React App project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asmaa-elfatayry/coffee-react-app.git
   ```

Apologies for the confusion. It's not possible to embed videos directly in a GitHub README file. However, you can use image placeholders to visually represent the videos being side by side. Here's an updated version of the README file template with the addition of image placeholders for the videos and the inclusion of images:

markdown
Copy code
